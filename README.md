# Planetoids: A Python Game Inspired by Asteroids

This project is a clone of the classic arcade game **Asteroids**, built as the final assignment for CS 1110 at Cornell University.

Due to academic integrity policies, the full code is **not** publicly available. However, the following materials demonstrate my contribution.

## Project Overview

**Planetoids** is a 2D space shooter game where the player pilots a ship through waves of asteroids. The project integrates graphics, physics simulation, and interactive input handling.

---

## Key Features

- Ship movement with physics-based impulse and inertia
- Screen-wrapping behavior for ship and asteroids
- Bullet firing and collision detection
- Asteroid break-up into smaller fragments
- Game states: welcome screen, active play, win/loss end states

---

## What I Learned

This was a deeply enriching project where I:

- Applied object-oriented programming with Python classes and inheritance
- Designed and managed game states using the MVC pattern
- Implemented vector-based physics and collision detection
- Practiced modular coding with helper methods and attributes
- Understood the importance of separation of concerns (e.g., controller vs model)

---

## Relevance to Data Science

While this is a game development project, it strengthened several skills directly applicable to data science:

- **Modular thinking & code architecture** (useful in pipelines and modeling)
- **Vector mathematics & geometry** (core to linear algebra & ML)
- **Data parsing from JSON** (a common data format)
- **Debugging complex systems incrementally**
